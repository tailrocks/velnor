# Velnor Rearchitecture — Master Plan

Living engineering source of truth for the Velnor rearchitecture program. Temporary
document for the duration of this effort; it is deleted when the work lands.

## 0. Immutable starting points

| Repository | Branch | Starting SHA (resolved live) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tailrocks/velnor` | `perf/docker-rust-mbx` | `2858e92df0eb78df4f1a6fe2ad4cbf86f1d56355` |
| `tailrocks/velnor-actions-fixture` | `codex/verifier-completion-fixes` | `5c8b57aa64dcbfd8fe6b2f6edae625ae344fc496` |

Both branch heads were re-resolved against `origin` at program start and matched the
SHAs recorded in the goal, so no newer head substitution was required.

Upstream semantic source of truth: `actions/runner`. The exact latest stable release
tag and source commit are being resolved live and recorded in §4.

## 1. Coordination protocol (two concurrent leads)

Two leads run independent multi-agent efforts against the same branch lines. To keep
that safe:

1. **Shared branches.** All work lands on `perf/docker-rust-mbx` (Velnor) and
   `codex/verifier-completion-fixes` (fixture). No private long-lived forks.
2. **Isolated working trees.** Each lead uses its own git worktree so nobody's
   checkout is switched or dirtied underneath a running agent. Never `git checkout`
   a different branch in a checkout you do not own.
3. **Small, frequent, focused commits, pushed immediately.** Rebase on
   `origin/<branch>` before every push; never force-push a shared branch.
4. **Ownership table.** Before starting implementation on an architectural boundary,
   claim it in §7. Do not write to a boundary another lead has claimed; escalate to
   the coordinator instead.
5. **Read-only investigation is unclaimed.** Any lead may investigate anything.
   Only *writes* need a claim.
6. **This file is append-mostly.** Add rows and sections rather than rewriting
   existing ones, so concurrent edits merge cleanly.

## 2. Method

Per the program rules:

- Opus agents own investigation, architecture, review, and final verification.
- Sonnet agents own bounded implementation tasks with explicit invariants.
- Every substantial implementation batch gets an independent Opus code review.
- No work package is accepted while an Opus reviewer holds an unresolved
  correctness or architectural finding.
- Work is judged by correctness, coherence, and goal fit — never by effort or diff
  size. A known-wrong state is never deferred as low-value, marginal, or rare.
- Every bug is treated as architectural evidence: identify the missing invariant and
  the boundary that permitted the bug class before proposing a fix; prefer removing
  the enabling condition over a symptom patch.

## 3. Investigation matrix (wave 1, in flight)

| ID | Scope | Report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I-01 | Runner slot + job lifecycle state machines | `01-lifecycle.md` |
| I-02 | GitHub V2 broker/run-service protocol, completion durability, crash recovery | `02-protocol-completion.md` |
| I-03 | GitHub workflow semantic model: expressions, conditions, outcome/conclusion, contexts | `03-semantics.md` |
| I-04 | Cancellation and timeout semantics | `04-cancellation.md` |
| I-05 | Docker runtime architecture; CLI vs Engine API; per-job call counts | `05-docker.md` |
| I-06 | Rust acceleration: Mr. Boxington, Cargo persistence, fingerprint stability, trust | `06-rust-mbx.md` |
| I-07 | Toolchain and dependency freshness; supply chain | `07-deps.md` |
| I-08 | Admission serialization, resource scheduling, async/blocking architecture | `08-concurrency.md` |
| I-09 | Verifier coverage architecture and Rust migration | `09-verifier.md` |

Wave 2 (queued): job image architecture, BuildKit lifecycle, checkout/filesystem
performance, cache and trust model, disk ownership and GC, action resolution and
JS/Docker/composite execution, results/artifact/timeline publishing, crate and module
organization, security and cross-job isolation, observability cost, benchmark
methodology, fault injection and soak design, production operability.

Wave 3: independent Opus architecture synthesis, then an independent Opus red-team
review of the synthesized target architecture, before any broad implementation.

# Testing

Use [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st) as test runner.

Install:

```sh
mise install
```

This installs the pinned Rust toolchain and dev tools (`cargo-nextest`,
`cargo-deny`, `cargo-audit`, and the rest of [mise.toml](mise.toml)) at the
same versions CI uses. Do not install these tools with ad hoc `cargo install`
commands.

Run all tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run
```

Run specific test:

```sh
cargo nextest run -E 'test(test_name)'
```

Run tests for specific module:

```sh
cargo nextest run -E 'test(/module::tests/)'
```

Run all feature-gated Rust tests except profile-isolated environment-backed smoke tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --all-features
```

Run Docker-backed smoke tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run -p jackin --features e2e --profile docker-e2e
```

In PR checkouts, run `jackin-dev pr sync <PR_NUMBER>` and source
`$(jackin-dev pr path <PR_NUMBER>)/env.sh` first. Outside the PR sync flow, use
`eval "$(cargo run --bin build-jackin-capsule -- --export)"` before the
Docker-backed smoke command.

### Mandatory macOS OrbStack usage-broker lane

Any change to usage discovery, coordinator/state, broker/relay transport, Capsule
refresh, Desktop refresh, or backend launch assembly requires this release-path gate
on Apple Silicon macOS 26 with OrbStack running:

```sh
cargo xtask ci --e2e
```

The `usage_broker_e2e` target must execute under the `docker-e2e` nextest profile;
zero matching tests is failure. Machine-readable evidence is the JUnit output under
`target/nextest/docker-e2e/`. The durable record belongs in the active PR check or
comment, never in committed logs/screenshots. A generic Docker daemon, a Linux temp
directory, or unit/process-only tests do not satisfy this macOS OrbStack lane. The
active PR and coordinator plan cannot be marked complete until the OrbStack run
records passing 2/20-client single-flight, owner-loss recovery, timeout
ownership, Desktop/Capsule generation adoption, capability isolation, distinct-
account concurrency, shared rate deadline/failure count, and unavailable-state zero-
call assertions.

All Rust tests run through `cargo nextest run`. Public documentation examples
must have nextest-discoverable regression tests. `cargo xtask ci-doc-examples
--package <crate>` rejects runnable rustdoc fences so examples cannot silently
create a second test surface outside nextest.

## CI performance contract

For a dependency graph that has completed before, every required CI job and the
required pipeline target should finish within one minute. A warm job must not
update the crates.io index, download an upstream crate, or compile an unchanged
registry/git dependency. The lane-scoped registry warmup is the sole owner of a
true cold fetch and builds `jackin-xtask` once for artifact reuse by downstream
gates. The same artifact carries the pinned Cargo CI tools so fan-out jobs do
not independently install `nextest`, `deny`, `shear`, `audit`, `fuzz`, `hack`,
or `sccache`. GitHub and Velnor use the same workflow, commands, cache keys, and
failure policy; Velnor may be faster only because its runner-local state
persists. The prepared xtask also has a seven-day artifact keyed by its actual
transitive source inputs, Cargo graph/configuration, toolchain, operating
system, and architecture. Unrelated workflow or docs edits therefore reuse the
binary instead of compiling it again. Runner configuration selects one
canonical cache writer: GitHub when it participates, or Velnor for a
Velnor-only dispatch. Both lanes restore that same portable output.

The required gate audits every completed job on every run. Its summary records
admission delay, runtime, every individual step duration, cache misses,
dependency/toolchain downloads, source-tool builds, and third-party
compile/check/build markers per job. Exact warm runs fail if any forbidden
download or build marker remains; producer runs retain the evidence for the
next optimization decision rather than hiding it behind an overall green
result.

A cold bootstrap is recorded as a cache miss, not hidden by raising the target.
Fan-out jobs stay offline and consume the warmup result. Cross-run compiler
result sharing is deferred to the [Shared CI compiler cache](<docs/content/roadmap/(infrastructure)/shared-ci-compiler-cache.mdx>)
roadmap item. `jackin-xtask affected-crates` reads the
Cargo metadata graph and maps a diff to changed crates plus their transitive
reverse workspace dependents. Workspace-wide inputs and unrecognized Rust paths
fail safe to every crate. Workflow and composite-action plumbing is not a crate
input and therefore creates no crate job by itself. The per-crate commands in
[`.github/ci/project.toml`](.github/ci/project.toml) (executed by the
[`.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml) units) define the
acceptance criteria; changing them invalidates prior proofs, while cache
transport, artifact lookup, and reporting changes reuse them. Each
selected cache miss owns one job and one
target-cache namespace, including default/all-feature checks, clippy, nextest,
documentation-example validation,
applicable powerset/benchmark/fuzz checks, and conditional Docker E2E.
When changed construct inputs require a fresh image, the `jackin` crate job
builds that image in its own Docker daemon before its E2E smoke test. There is
no separate construct-image test job or large tar artifact handoff.
Scheduling follows the reverse dependency closure; the input-identical target
artifact key follows the forward dependency closure. Each seven-day artifact
stores the crate's first-party and third-party fingerprints, libraries,
binaries, build outputs, and test executables. CI uses only the newest pinned
stable compiler, so no older-toolchain outputs or compatibility cache are
created. This preserves crate-specific Cargo feature and profile variants without placing 26 mostly overlapping
archives in GitHub's small repository cache quota. The configured canonical
writer publishes one output for both GitHub and Velnor to restore.

After both lane warmups complete, one GitHub-hosted control-plane job resolves
the affected set and shared result markers. Selection is deliberately outside
the runner matrix: matrix job outputs have one shared value, so whichever lane
finishes last could otherwise replace the canonical package list. Both lanes
still consume the same contracts and run the same per-crate workflow; the
central selector only decides which independently attributable crate jobs
exist. It also resolves target-artifact metadata once for every selected miss,
so GitHub and Velnor do not repeat the same repository API search before
restoring the identical target archive. Both lanes download that one archive
through the same GitHub REST artifact path; target transport does not depend on a
runner-specific Results Service action adapter. A runner with an existing current
Cargo target uses that local state as the first seed and lets Cargo
validate it; an incomplete or empty runner restores the portable artifact. This is one shared
fallback order, not a lane-specific verification path.

An exact target-key miss first restores that crate's latest successful target
as a seed. Cargo still validates every fingerprint and rebuilds changed
first-party outputs, but unchanged registry and git dependencies remain
available instead of being recompiled solely because the crate source key
changed. Only an exact source-closure hit backdates checkout mtimes; a latest
seed preserves current source mtimes so Cargo cannot accept stale first-party
objects. A successful miss publishes both the new exact target and a small
latest-target pointer; it does not duplicate the target archive.

## Verification matrix

| Change surface | Command | When |
|---|---|---|
| One module | `cargo nextest run -E 'test(/module::tests/)'` | inner loop |
| One crate | `cargo nextest run -p <crate>` + `cargo clippy -p <crate> --all-targets -- -D warnings` | before commit |
| Cross-crate Rust | `cargo xtask ci --fast` | before PR |
| Full non-Docker gate | `cargo xtask ci` | merge readiness |
| One CI partition | `cargo xtask ci --only <lint\|policy\|tests\|snapshots\|docs\|powerset>` | inner loop mirroring a CI lane |
| Scoped feature powerset | `cargo hack check -p jackin -p jackin-diagnostics -p jackin-capsule -p jackin-agent-status -p jackin-runtime --feature-powerset --all-targets --locked` | optional-feature crates (PR gate) |
| Container/runtime behavior | `cargo xtask ci --e2e` (Docker running) | capsule/runtime PRs |
| Desktop / native Swift | `mise run desktop-ci` (PR cadence); `mise run desktop-merge` adds `desktop-test-ui` on a logged-in macOS host; `mise run desktop-scheduled` adds `desktop-deadcode` | Desktop UI, bridge, or usage projection changes; PR gate: `swift-package-native` unit |
| Docs/roadmap | `cargo xtask roadmap audit && cargo xtask docs repo-links && cargo xtask research check` | any docs edit |
| File-size gate | `cargo xtask lint files` (`--format json\|github`) | structure / split PRs |
| README freshness (advisory) | `cargo xtask lint readme-freshness --base origin/main` | structural `crates/*/src` A/D/R without README touch |
| Agents gate | `cargo xtask lint agents` (`--format json\|github`) | new crate / AGENTS files |
| TUI snapshots | `cargo nextest run -p jackin-capsule -p jackin-console` (insta snapshots live only in these two crates today) | TUI render changes |

Every first-party `cargo xtask lint <gate>`, `docs <gate>`, `research check`, and
`roadmap audit` command accepts `--format json|github`. JSON violations use
schema 1 with `file`, nullable `line`, `message`, `fix`, and exact `rerun`
fields. The shared problem matcher is registered by CI for human/GitHub output.

### Snapshot review policy

Changed `.snap` files are enumerated in CI against the PR merge-base with `origin/main` (step summary + job log). Reviewers must acknowledge each listed snapshot; hand-edited snapshots that merely match buggy output are rejected in review. Pending files (`*.pending-snap`) still fail CI. Prefer `cargo insta review` / `cargo insta accept` over hand-editing `.snap` bodies.


Every Rust workspace member is verified by `cargo nextest run -p <crate>`. The
Swift shell is verified by `cargo xtask desktop test` and the Desktop commands
above. Governed PR CI runs the Swift units in the generated
[`.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml) (generated by
velnor-workflow, dispatches `ci-unit-swift.yml` via `group-swift`); those units
are the PR gate named in the verification matrix.
The `jackin` E2E
tests additionally need `--features e2e --profile docker-e2e`. Documentation
examples are mirrored into ordinary tests and checked with `cargo xtask
ci-doc-examples --package <crate>`. The machine-checkable per-member map is
also emitted by `cargo xtask health --format json` under `verification_map`.

## Recording capsule render-conformance fixtures

Capsule echo-back harness ([crates/jackin-capsule/src/daemon/tests.rs](crates/jackin-capsule/src/daemon/tests.rs)) replays reviewed PTY byte streams through the multiplexer and asserts that emitted frames reproduce the pane model on a virtual client terminal. Synthetic streams live in the harness. Real-agent fixture capture is an explicit test workflow, never a telemetry side effect:

1. Set `JACKIN_PTY_FIXTURE_CAPTURE` to an operator-selected temporary capture path and run the specific capture scenario.
2. Review the temporary capture for secrets and unstable content.
3. Copy the reviewed bytes into the fixture tree with `cargo xtask pty-fixture <capture.bin> crates/jackin-capsule/tests/fixtures/pty/<fixture.bin>`.
4. Reference the fixture with `include_bytes!` and add the scenario to the fixture README.

Without the capture variable, production and test sessions do not write PTY streams. OTLP telemetry never contains PTY bytes.

## Walking the operator through local validation

Every `jackin <subcommand>` invocation in manual validation MUST include `--debug`. This includes `cargo run --bin jackin -- <subcommand> --debug` from a checkout. Debug mode controls operator troubleshooting output; it does not create a telemetry or diagnostics file.

When validating observability, start the dev-only OTLP testbed or another trusted gRPC backend, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, and run `jackin diagnostics validate` first. Use `cli.invocation.id` and `session.id` to inspect the run in the backend. With no endpoint, telemetry remains disabled and no local fallback artifact is written.

Smoke tests: suggest `jackin console` first, prefer `the-architect` role over `agent-smith`. Standard smoke command:

```bash
cargo run --bin jackin -- console --debug
```

Use `jackin load` only when PR specifically needs that CLI path:

```bash
cargo run --bin jackin -- load the-architect . --debug
```

No `--no-intro` on debug smoke — debug mode already suppresses intro; `--debug --no-intro` = redundant.

Unexpected behavior from a clean run → first ask the operator to rerun with `--debug` and share the visible failure details. When OTLP is configured, use the invocation id to inspect governed backend telemetry before proposing fixes.

Does not apply to:

- Inspection commands operator runs (`pgrep`, `pmset`, `cat`, `ls`) — not `jackin` invocations.
- Production recommendations or scripted automation (debug output too noisy).

## Flakes and fuzz

### Flake policy

CI nextest uses `[profile.ci]` (`.config/nextest.toml`): fixed 2 retries with a 1s delay and `final-status-level = "flaky"`. A pass-on-retry is reported as flaky — never silently absorbed. The matrix is exactly one job per affected crate that requires testing; an input-identical successful result is resolved before matrix expansion and does not consume a runner. It has no shards, multi-crate buckets, older-toolchain lanes, or second jobs for crate-specific clippy, benchmarks, powersets, fuzzing, or Docker tests. The `jackin` job owns its conditional Docker E2E steps. Every crate job uploads `target/nextest/ci/junit.xml` and fails if any flaky test is not listed in the shrink-only quarantine ledger `flaky-tests.toml` (repo root; each `[[test]]` needs `name`, `owner`, `reason`, `since`). Prefer fixing the flake over quarantining.

Native UI tests run outside nextest and require a logged-in macOS session.
`mise run desktop-test-ui` writes one JUnit report per XCTest under the ignored
`native/.build/test-results/` tree. The script does not retry failures. If a manual
rerun proves an XCTest intermittent, review its report under the same
`flaky-tests.toml` owner/reason/since policy; the current nextest analyzer does not
ingest XCTest reports, so the active PR must record the disposition explicitly.

An input-identical successful crate result is reused for seven days before any
toolchain, registry, or target restore. Its key includes the crate's forward
workspace dependency closure, Cargo and toolchain inputs, runner platform,
feature and Docker modes, and the semantic crate-test contract. The selector
removes a hit before matrix expansion. It runs once after both lane warmups, so
queued runner capacity is reserved for real cache misses and the routing
summary records every reuse. Any changed input
runs the complete contract in one dedicated crate job and publishes a
replacement marker from the configured canonical writer for both GitHub and
Velnor to consume. Docker inputs and
execution modes affect only the `jackin` result, because that crate owns the
single conditional Docker E2E path.

Construct Image uses the same pattern at its own correctness boundary. Its
seven-day marker covers the construct sources, Docker and Cargo/tool inputs,
publish-versus-rehearsal mode, and requested runner lanes. An unrelated commit
therefore does not rebuild unchanged amd64/arm64 images, while any construct
input or lane-mode change runs the complete platform matrix.

CI also publishes a seven-day result for the complete verification contract,
keyed by every Rust, workflow, tool, test, policy, and Docker input plus the
requested runner lanes. The selector runs before matrix expansion. An exact hit
allocates only the stable required-status gate; it does not repeat formatting,
action linting, tool or registry preparation, policy checks, affected-crate
selection, or crate jobs. A miss retains the component selectors below, so only
affected crates and genuinely stale components allocate their dedicated jobs.
Cache and artifact contracts used by runner-selectable jobs are resolved once
by the GitHub-hosted metadata job and passed unchanged to both GitHub and
Velnor. Runner-local expression support therefore cannot silently produce a
different or empty key. A target is one archive published in one operation;
numbered transport parts are forbidden. Latest-target pointers resolve the run
that owns the referenced archive rather than assuming the pointer's run also
owns it.

The repository policy set has a one-day component marker keyed by the semantic
base revision, Rust/policy inputs, and requested lanes. Pull requests use their
base SHA and the matching post-merge `main` push uses its `before` SHA, so the
same successful proof crosses the squash-merge boundary. A hit skips schema,
ratchet, dependency-policy, README-freshness, and audit jobs while actionlint,
formatting, tool warmup, affected-crate selection, and the required-status gate
still execute. This is not a whole-pipeline result: crate/tool producers remain
able to repopulate their artifacts on every normal run.
Producer run `29506850819` published the first marker after executing the full
policy set. A later normal PR run with unchanged semantic inputs is the required
warm proof; rerunning the producer attempt is not valid because GitHub may
replace artifacts attached to that run ID.

Docs prepares the pinned `codebook-lsp` binary once and publishes a seven-day
platform/tool-contract artifact. The docs and source spell jobs download that
same binary instead of each invoking Cargo through mise; only a genuinely new
Codebook version or platform may take the source-build fallback.
The built static site is published as a seven-day repository artifact keyed by
its workflow, docs sources, generated crate README inputs, dependency lock, and
build configuration. Unlike a GitHub Actions cache, the artifact is not scoped
to a pull-request merge ref, so the matching `main` push can reuse the PR build.
An exact hit installs only lychee and skips Bun/Node setup, dependency
installation, and site build; the miss path rebuilds and republishes the same
output for link checking and Pages upload.
Producer run `29508481632` published the corrected cross-ref site artifact. Warm
proof must come from a later normal run whose site-contract inputs are
unchanged, followed by the matching post-merge `main` run.
Docs publishes a separate seven-day successful-result marker keyed by the full
site, repository-link, generated-source, spelling, tool, and workflow contract.
An exact pull-request hit allocates only `docs-required`. The matching `main`
push additionally restores the built-site artifact and uploads it for Pages,
but does not repeat repository-link or spelling jobs already proven by the pull
request. Deployment and deployed-site verification remain `main` responsibilities.
The repository-link job restores the same prepared `jackin-xtask` artifact as
CI and installs only lychee, so it does not maintain a second Rust build/cache
path for identical source inputs. Because Docs and CI are independent workflows
for the same revision, the downloader gives the concurrent CI producer one
bounded 40-second window to publish a newly keyed tool artifact. It never falls
back to compiling the workspace in Docs.

Required PR/main CI runs the real
`jackin_load_ctrl_q_yes_exits_cold_build_quickly` Docker smoke inside the
`jackin` crate job. Scheduled hygiene runs the complete serialized Docker E2E
suite, including every chaos scenario. This keeps a real construct/launch path
on every relevant change without placing the suite's measured four-minute
runtime on the required pipeline.

Affected crate jobs compile and smoke each owned fuzz target for five seconds.
Scheduled hygiene retains the 120-300 second campaigns for the same targets,
including the nightly AddressSanitizer run.

Junit artifacts are named `nextest-junit-<crate>-<lane>` and seed the Phase 0 suite-wall-time baseline once measured.
Each package job runs `cargo xtask lint ratchet --only suite-time`; it must not invoke
the all-family ratchet because unrelated artifact providers can add hidden build
work. The telemetry conformance job similarly owns generation of
`target/telemetry-volume-ratchet.json` and enforces only `export-volume` after
the producing test completes. Missing artifact-backed inputs skip outside their
owning job instead of launching nested Cargo commands.

### Fuzz targets

The terminal model's fuzz and nextest suites (`damage_grid_process`,
conformance replay, allocation) live in the
[termpane](https://github.com/tailrocks/termpane) repo, not here.

| Target | Crate path | Smoke (PR / ci-pr.yml) | Long (hygiene) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config_migrate` | `crates/jackin-config/fuzz` | 5s | 120s |
| `workspace_migrate` | `crates/jackin-config/fuzz` | 5s | 120s |
| `manifest_migrate` | `crates/jackin-manifest/fuzz` | 5s | 120s |
| `manifest_validate` | `crates/jackin-manifest/fuzz` | 5s | 120s |
| `env_resolve` | `crates/jackin-env/fuzz` | 5s | 120s |
| `decode_frames` | `crates/jackin-protocol/fuzz` | 5s | 120s |

Local smoke (nightly + cargo-fuzz via mise):

```sh
cd crates/jackin-config && cargo fuzz run --sanitizer none config_migrate -- -max_total_time=30
```

Committed seeds live under each fuzz crate's `corpus/<target>/` (fixture-derived TOML for migrate/validate targets; tag+payload frames for `decode_frames`). **Promotion rule:** when a fuzzer finds a crash or hang, (1) minimize with `cargo fuzz cmin <target>` / `tmin`, (2) commit the minimized input under `corpus/<target>/`, (3) add a deterministic regression test in the owning crate that feeds the same bytes (or the decoded fixture) so the finding never re-enters CI only via the fuzzer. Do not grow corpora with non-minimized corpus dirs from long runs without `cmin`.

Migration fixture harness ([`crates/jackin/tests/migration_fixtures.rs`](crates/jackin/tests/migration_fixtures.rs)) enforces golden equality against `after.toml` and second-pass idempotence for every config/workspace/manifest fixture.

### Full DinD E2E lane (scheduled)

Hygiene job `dind-chaos` runs the complete nine-test suite against real Docker,
including the three seeded fault scenarios
(`chaos_kill_container_mid_session`, `chaos_sigkill_capsule`, `chaos_drop_control_socket`).
Replay: `JACKIN_CHAOS_SEED=<n> cargo nextest run -p jackin --features e2e --profile docker-e2e -E 'test(chaos_kill_container_mid_session)'`.
Default seed is fixed (`0xc4a0_55eed`); `workflow_dispatch` input `chaos_seed` overrides.

## Allocation lane (dhat) — static budget policy (plan 026)

The `dhat-heap` allocation suite in `jackin-capsule` runs on
the scheduled Hygiene workflow (`dhat-allocation` job, advisory /
`continue-on-error`). **Ratchet decision:** keep `perf_dhat_budgets` fed from
the static ceilings in [`crates/jackin-capsule/src/perf_budgets.rs`](crates/jackin-capsule/src/perf_budgets.rs) (in-test
guardrails + textual ratchet). Measured dhat output is artifacted for trend
inspection but does **not** yet drive the ratchet — re-evaluate after ≥3
stable scheduled runs on the same runner class. Never budget from a single run.

## Advisory measurement lanes (hygiene schedule)

Trigger manually: `gh workflow run Hygiene` (or wait for the daily cron).

| Lane | Job | Artifact | Gate? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Criterion performance | `bench-run` | `criterion-results-<run-id>` | 5% regression ceiling against reviewed GitHub-hosted x86_64 medians |
| Beta clippy canary | `beta-clippy-canary` | `beta-clippy-log` | advisory — `continue-on-error` |
| Coverage (llvm-cov) | `coverage` | `coverage.lcov` | advisory — artifact only |
| Miri pure crates | `miri` | step summary | advisory |
| ASan fuzz (scheduled) | `scheduled-hygiene` step | step log | advisory (PR fuzz stays `--sanitizer none`) |
| cargo-mutants | `mutants` | `mutants-out` | advisory — never fails job |
| hakari timing | `hakari-timing` | `cargo-timings-hygiene-baseline` | advisory investigation only |
| Cold-start + PTY frames | `cold-start-bench` | `cold-start.json`, `frame-timing.json` (first frame + input repaint, 3 samples) | advisory measurement |
| rust-analyzer clean | `rust-analyzer-clean` | `ra-stats.txt` | advisory — `continue-on-error` on error grep |
| Per-crate build times | `build-time-measure` | `build-times.json` (5 crates × clean/incremental) | scheduled `build-time` ceiling ratchet |
| dylint render purity | `dylint-advisory` | `dylint-findings` | advisory — `continue-on-error`; nightly pin in `crates/jackin-lints` |

The Criterion gate compares absolute medians on its pinned GitHub-hosted x86_64
runner class. Do not normalize those medians with an unrelated microbenchmark:
the calibration workload and frame/render workloads respond differently to
runner CPU variation, which can manufacture a regression while the measured
workload remains stable. Failed comparisons still upload the current Criterion
estimates so a baseline change can be reviewed from retained evidence.



## First-frame / input-to-frame harness (plan 026)

`cargo xtask frame-timing` launches the built host console through a 120×36 PTY,
waits for alternate-screen entry plus the first substantial paint, injects a
Down-arrow event, and measures the next repaint. Three independent samples are
written to `frame-timing.json`; the scheduled lane keeps this advisory because
host scheduling noise is still material, but a missing/blank frame fails the
job instead of silently producing a number.

The same Hygiene workflow writes `build-times.json`, copies it to `target/`, and
runs the `build-time` artifact-ceiling ratchet. The family is skipped explicitly
when the scheduled artifact is absent (normal local/PR lint) and hard-fails the
scheduled job when any clean or incremental build exceeds its reviewed ceiling.

# jackin-dev

The `jackin-dev` PR-verification and contributor tooling binary — installed locally and used to prepare an isolated checkout for reviewing/verifying a PR (`jackin-dev pr sync`, `jackin-dev pr path`, env setup). A developer/agent tool, not part of the jackin❯ runtime.

## What this crate owns

- The `jackin-dev` CLI (`main`): PR-sync, PR-path resolution, env-script emission, and related contributor workflows.
- Its own unit tests (`tests`).

## Architecture tier and allowed dependencies

**Standalone binary (tooling).** No workspace dependencies — it bootstraps an environment *before* the workspace is necessarily built, so it must not depend on jackin❯ runtime crates. Third-party deps are kept minimal.

## Structure

| Module | Owns | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| [`main.rs`](src/main.rs) | the `jackin-dev` CLI | — |
| [`tests.rs`](src/tests.rs) | unit tests | — |

## Public API

The `jackin-dev` binary surface (`pr sync <N>`, `pr path <N>`, etc.) is documented in the PR-verification workflow under `.github/`. Not a library.

## How to verify

```sh
cargo nextest run -p jackin-dev
cargo clippy -p jackin-dev --all-targets -- -D warnings
jackin-dev --version
```

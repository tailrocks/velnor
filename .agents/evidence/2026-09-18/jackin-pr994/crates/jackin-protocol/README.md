# jackin-protocol

Shared wire-format contracts for the host CLI and `jackin-capsule`.

This crate holds serde types, constants, control messages, and shared terminal-handshake adapters that cross the host/container boundary. Keeping them here lets the host `jackin` binary and the in-container Capsule binary agree on socket paths, launch config shape, attach protocol messages, terminal defaults, and runtime commands without either side depending on the other's full implementation stack.

The crate should stay dependency-light and protocol-focused. Runtime behavior belongs in the host CLI or `jackin-capsule`; shared data contracts belong here.

## Public API

Primary entry: [`ClientFrame`](src/attach.rs) (attach-protocol client frames). Related types:

- `ServerFrame` — capsule→host attach frames
- `ClipboardImageError` — typed clipboard image failure signal (wire payload remains a human-readable message; `from_message` classifies free-form host text)
- `ClientMsg` / `ServerMsg` — control-channel JSON frames
- `TelemetryContext` — validated W3C trace context propagated across host/Capsule control frames
- `host_terminal` — the single OSC 10/11 default-color handshake and input-preservation adapter used by both attach clients
- `StatusSlot` — semantic status-bar glance slot a usage quota window fills (`session`, `daily`, `weekly`, `spend`); `daily` carries Amp Free's `N% remaining today` allowance
- `FocusedUsageView::is_refreshing_placeholder()` — one machine predicate for the exact cold `refreshing` placeholder invariant, so host/Swift code never compares display strings
- `usage_broker` — versioned, secret-free request/response records for host-owned usage refresh coordination, including opaque account capabilities, generation state, bounded wait requests, and sanitized failure categories
- `UsageDetailPresentation` / `UsageDetailRow` / `UsagePresentationLine` / `UsageDetailRowKind` — the shared Capsule-parity provider-detail card contract: fixed row order (focused, header, provider, account, status, updated, optional username/plan/auth, `bucket:<i>` per source bucket, optional detail), position-based bucket ids, and already-grouped `leading`/`trailing` layout lines. `display_label` equals the row's non-empty line fields joined with `" · "`. Built by `jackin_usage::usage::usage_detail_presentation`; the Capsule dialog and the Desktop Usage window render it verbatim.

`#![deny(missing_docs)]` is on; public surface is rustdoc-complete.

# Engineering rules

Cross-cutting code-craft rules for every session: dependency choices, DRY, telemetry, comments. Apply to Rust source, Dockerfile snippets in `docker/`, shell scripts under `docker/runtime/` and `docker/construct/`, `justfile` recipes, CI workflow steps, TypeScript helpers under `docs/scripts/`.

## Rust-first implementation default

Prefer Rust for new project-owned automation, CLIs, release tooling, parsers, state machines, and long-lived helpers. Use another language only where the surrounding ecosystem makes it the natural fit (for example docs-site TypeScript, shell inside container entrypoints, or tiny glue that must run before Rust tooling exists), and keep that exception local rather than growing a parallel implementation stack.

## Prefer libraries over hand-rolled parsers / serializers / format handlers

**Default to maintained crate. Hand-roll only when crate unmaintained, API awkward for call site, or usage trivially small.**

Must use crate, not hand-rolled:

- YAML parsing → `serde_yaml_ng` (or fork workspace depends on). No line-by-line YAML scanner.
- TOML parsing → `toml` / `toml_edit` (already in workspace).
- JSON parsing → `serde_json` (already in workspace).
- Date/time, base64, semver, URL parsing, hex, regex — pick maintained ecosystem crate.
- Cryptographic primitives — never roll own; use `ring`, `rustls`, `argon2`, etc.
- SQLite / embedded-DB access → **`turso` only** (the workspace's single DB stack; see [usage_snapshot_store.rs](crates/jackin-usage/src/usage_snapshot_store.rs)). Never `rusqlite`, `diesel`-on-SQLite, or any other SQLite binding — a second SQLite stack is a continuity-with-workspace violation. `turso`'s API is async, so a sync caller must make its path async (or `block_on` a runtime handle), not reach for a sync binding.
- Native FFI bindings → **`boltffi` only** (see [jackin-usage-ffi](crates/jackin-usage-ffi/)). Never `uniffi` — it is workspace-banned in [deny.toml](deny.toml) and must not return in any crate.

"Trivially small" carve-out narrow: single five-line helper splitting one fixed-format string fine. Multi-state line-by-line scanner with quote handling, comment stripping, indent rules, or anything smelling like reimplementing parser — not.

Choosing crate, prefer:

- **popular, canonical option** — check crates.io download counts (recent + total), GitHub stars, breadth of ecosystem dependents. Famous crates get most bug reports, fixes, security review. Niche / low-download only when no maintained alternative;
- **active recent maintenance** — commits / releases within ~12 months, ideally less. Open issues triaged. Multiple contributors, not single-person;
- **stable major version** (1.x+) where possible — pre-1.0 acceptable when crate still canonical (e.g. `clap`'s subcommand derive history) but flag in PR;
- **continuity with workspace** — if sibling dependency already appears in [Cargo.lock](Cargo.lock), prefer over alternative adding new transitive tree;
- **panic-free / error-result-returning APIs** over panic-on-bad-input (matters at trust boundaries — host config, network responses, untrusted user input).

Anti-pattern: pulling fresh-but-obscure crate from search results. Crate with 30 stars, no recent commits, one author *worse* than canonical-but-deprecated alternative — deprecated one battle-tested. Prefer (in order): popular + maintained → popular but stale → write few lines yourself. No fringe crates.

When canonical crate *deprecated* but no clear successor: document choice in PR — name deprecation, candidate forks evaluated, criterion that picked winner. Stops re-debating later.

Rationale: Rust ecosystem leverage point. Pulling crate usually 50–200 KB and one [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) line. Reinventing parsers wastes review attention, multiplies bug surface, misses upstream fixes.

When you do hand-roll something this rule covers, comment why (crate unavailable, scope tiny, dependency cost rejected) so later maintainer can replace without re-debating.

## Reuse before writing — DRY (hard rule)

**Before writing new code, check whether something close enough exists. If yes, extend/parameterise/wrap it, not parallel copy. If no, write in shape future callers can reuse.**

Applies to *every* layer: render helpers, state-derivation functions, parsing/validation, CLI argument structs, docker mount-list builders, TUI block layout, dialog dispatch, OS abstraction, hook scripts, build scripts. About to write function "mostly same as `<other_function>` but one branch flipped" — stop, refactor existing to accept difference, use it.

Checks before adding new code:

1. **`grep` for verb, noun, surrounding nouns.** "render global mounts" → `rg 'global_mount' src/`. "derive cwd from manifest" → `rg 'fn .*cwd|manifest.*cwd' src/`. Multi-noun phrases catch helpers named for adjacent concepts. One match — read before writing new function; multiple — duplication already started, flag in PR even if change narrow.
2. **Walk call sites of closest match.** Existing function with two-three callers passing different args — usually add parameter (or small enum) and route every caller through it. If call sites grow ugly to share, *say so in comment* on new function, keep duplication explicit.
3. **Look one directory up.** Helpers often live in `<feature>/mod.rs`, `console/manager/render/mod.rs`, `runtime/mod.rs`, `instance/mod.rs`. If `<feature>/sub.rs` about to grow private helper not depending on `sub.rs`-only state, helper belongs in parent `mod.rs` (or sibling `helpers.rs`).
4. **Symmetric variants demand symmetric implementations.** Two functions handling "current dir" vs "saved workspace" — or "agent" vs "shell" — or "Linux" vs "macOS" — per-variant deltas should be data, not control flow. Both paths run `f()` + `g()` + `h()` in slightly different order or one missing call — missing call almost always bug waiting to surface (one variant extended, other not). Pull shared sequence into one function, pass variant-specific bits as args.
5. **Constraints / extension points beat copies.** New caller needing *slightly* different behaviour, prefer (in order): (a) new parameter with sensible default; (b) small `enum` matched inside existing function; (c) trait taken by reference. Forking into `do_foo_for_x` and `do_foo_for_y` last resort, only when divergence structural enough that shared body confuses more than two siblings.

Why: every parallel implementation future bug. Extend one path, forget other — divergence surfaces later as "feature works on workspace screen but not current-directory screen", class of bug this project hit before. Adding parameter advances both paths together; adding second function makes them drift.

Patterns this blocks (real findings):

- `sidebar_inputs_for_workspace` and `sidebar_inputs_for_current_dir` build same `SidebarInputs` struct with overlapping body. Extending one while leaving other untouched — the bug. Fix: factor divergent piece (picker-role resolution, role-binding presence) into helpers both call, not another sibling function for third selection kind.
- `focused_block_still_scrollable` matching only `ManagerListRow::SavedWorkspace` for global-mounts focus while render path also accepts `ManagerListRow::CurrentDirectory`. Render and scrollability checks must read from same selection-to-rows helper, else focus calculation lags visible content.
- Adding per-agent `LAUNCH=` block to [docker/runtime/entrypoint.sh](docker/runtime/entrypoint.sh) when existing block handles "agent X with optional credential mount" via `case`. Extend the `case`, not duplicate surrounding `seed_home_dir` / chmod / exec scaffolding.

When you do duplicate (deltas too structural for shared body, or shared body defers divergent decision to runtime branch hurting readability), leave one-line comment on each copy naming sibling and *reason* divergence preserved.

## Governed observability (hard rule)

All application telemetry uses `jackin-telemetry`. Register the semantic name, attributes, bounded values, and signal type first; then emit through the event, operation, metric, or spawn facade. Product crates must not construct OpenTelemetry instruments, use arbitrary telemetry targets, or turn operator prose into attributes.

Severity reflects meaning: INFO for lifecycle and state change, WARN for handled degradation, ERROR for failed operations, DEBUG for diagnostic decisions, and TRACE only for narrowly governed high-frequency detail. Default telemetry stays compact. Anything expected more than roughly ten times per minute belongs at DEBUG/TRACE or becomes an aggregated metric, but privacy rules still prohibit raw PTY, input, rendered content, argv, paths, names, and secrets at every level.

Use bounded operation guards for work with latency and outcome. Never create lifetime spans for a process, console, screen, session, tab, or pane. Joined work inherits context; detached, blocking, cycle, stream, and prewarm work uses the matching ownership helper so parentage and links remain honest. Every failure and cancellation path closes its guard.

Operator output is a separate port. `--debug`, compact notices, and explicit evidence exports help a human troubleshoot; they do not bypass the registry or create a telemetry sink. `RunDiagnostics` is bounded current-invocation UI state, not history. Durable observability goes directly over OTLP and the backend owns history. See [Application observability](docs/content/reference/runtime/diagnostics.mdx).

## Code comments — explain only what is not obvious

**Comments earn place by encoding non-obvious WHY, not narrating WHAT.** Well-named identifiers, type signatures, surrounding code already say what code does; repeating comment is noise that pushes signal off-screen and rots faster than code.

Comment when, and only when, one true:

- Code looks suspicious/weird/wrong on first read but intentional. Name constraint forcing it (TOCTOU, parser-bypass safety, ordering invariant, race window, kernel quirk, upstream bug).
- Non-local invariant preserved. Point at invariant and dependent call site.
- Shape could reasonably be written differently. Name trade-off that picked it.
- Code interacts with externally documented behaviour unfamiliar reader won't predict (POSIX edge case, Docker daemon quirk, library footgun).

Do not comment when:

- Identifier name already says it (`fn provision_amp_auth` needs no `// Provision Amp auth`).
- Signature already says it (`Result<T, io::Error>` needs no `// returns an io::Error on failure`).
- Control flow says it (`for x in items { … }` needs no `// loop over items`).
- Diff says it (`// renamed from foo`, `// added in PR #N`, `// previously did X`).

Style:

- One sentence over paragraph. Trim until removing one more word breaks clarity.
- Lead with constraint, not code. "TOCTOU on settings.json: …" beats "We do this thing because there is a TOCTOU…".
- Drop "mirrors X" / "matches Y" parallel-structure narration — parallel code structure already encodes it, cross-reference dates moment one side drifts.
- Code blocks, function names, error strings, CLI flag names exact, never abbreviated; prose around them as terse as possible.

Applies to inline `//`, multi-line `/** */` / `///` / `//!` doc comments, test-method docstrings. Operator-facing surfaces (`clap` `--help` text, `eprintln!` lines, README prose) follow docs split rules loading under `docs/` — not "comments" here.

Do not memorialize old shapes in code comments ("formerly named X", "old location was Y"). Git history is record; code describes only current shape.

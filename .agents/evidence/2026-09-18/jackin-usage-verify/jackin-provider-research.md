# Jackin code audit and provider research

Research date: 17 September 2026. This report combines a read-only GitHub audit, the supplied `.zshrc` excerpt, current vendor documentation, and source inspection of CodexBar, OpenUsage, and relevant upstream clients. Six parallel research/audit tracks covered the repository and providers; separate reviewers checked the resulting specification and verification plan.

No real user account, Mac keychain, provider login, paid inference, or local container was exercised. “Verified” below means verified in the cited documentation/source unless a live result is explicitly supplied later. Version/schema/auth isolation checks on the user's Mac remain execution requirements.

## 1. Findings that determine the design

1. **This is an extension of an existing platform.** Jackin already has named accounts, account forms, custom folders, credential references, discovery, a usage broker, usage projections, several provider collectors, a Console Usage screen, and Capsule/desktop consumers.
2. **The core container limitation is one selected account per agent type.** The current launch/credential/config/session pipeline cannot represent two differently authenticated Claude Code instances in one container. Add explicit container admission and per-instance bindings throughout the current pipeline.
3. **The current Console is not yet a periodic monitor.** Opening copies cached rows; manual refresh performs synchronous per-account joins. Connect it to asynchronous broker events and scheduling.
4. **Agent, provider product, credential source, account and model are different entities.** OpenRouter/Z.AI are providers; OpenCode/omp/Hermes are clients that may hold many providers; one Kimi account may fund Kimi, Claude and Codex. A model preset is not a second account.
5. **There is no universal remaining-token API.** Session/weekly/monthly percentages, monetary balances, provider credits, requests and hours must retain their units. Missing quota is a typed unavailable capability, never 0% remaining.
6. **Freshness and identity need evidence.** A successful cached Muse report may still be old; an Antigravity command may omit identity; two profiles can contain the same rotating OAuth grant. The broker must track observation time, source identity, scope and ownership.
7. **Current sources differ from older assumptions.** Antigravity has a real CLI; Kimi has a new CLI family; Kimi/Z.AI officially support Codex Responses; OpenRouter account balance now needs management access; OpenCode Go exposes a first-party usage route.
8. **Some gaps require local proof rather than invented implementation details.** Muse Linux installer/native auth layout, Amp current native login storage, keyring isolation, and exact live provider schemas must be checked with the installed clients.

A research SHA is not a recommendation to ship an upstream development build. Resolve and pin a tested release/image artifact during implementation. Official documentation can move; record fetch date and the exact installed version/schema used by each fixture.

Evidence classes used below:

- **D — documented:** vendor documents the API/CLI contract.
- **S — first-party source:** provider/client source implements it; a remote service may still be internal and version-sensitive.
- **R — reference implementation:** CodexBar/OpenUsage/omp demonstrates an internal integration; not a vendor stability commitment.
- **U — unresolved:** no adequate public proof or no local/live test yet.

## 3. Jackin existing implementation and gaps

| Area | Already present | Extension required |
|---|---|---|
| Account registry | Named `AppConfig.accounts`, enabled state, profiles/API keys/Claude token, secret references | More services/auth layouts; granular provider entries; configuration/model presets distinct from account identity |
| Bootstrap | `ConfigEditor::open` discovers sources when config file is absent | Explicit initialization state, retained issues, concurrency-safe import, older installation handling |
| Scan | `jackin account scan` | Reuse in Settings asynchronously; preserve unsaved edits and existing defaults |
| Settings | Accounts list, manual add/edit, custom path, provider/model/base URL, enable/default | Scan button/action; new source variants, models and usage permission states |
| Workspace policy | Many allowed account IDs plus global/workspace/role preferred defaults | Separate actual container admission and initial/later session bindings |
| Launch choice | One-off account selection and default resolver | Console's committed-agent path must honor a configured default instead of always picking when several candidates exist |
| Provisioning | Protected files, selected sources, credential env scrub | Actual launch currently provisions `[agent]`; repeated agent instances need new binding-aware paths throughout |
| Auth transport | `AgentCredentialEnv` map keyed by agent name | Key by instance/account binding where multiplicity is required |
| Capsule | Agent/provider metadata, models/auth modes, PTY sessions and usage dialog | Actual account ID/name/model binding on spawn/split/restore/history/tab |
| OpenCode import | Detects auth file and copies profile | Extract selected provider/key entry; don't copy the whole multi-provider store |
| Usage | Eight host surfaces; broker, canonical projection, last-good state, relay | New service catalog and richer typed metrics; registered inventory authoritative |
| Console Usage | Top-level `u` route, rows/detail, `r` | Asynchronous refresh on open and periodically, stable ID selection, full freshness/detail data |
| Local verification | Nextest, fixture/process/Docker tests, TUI snapshots | Extend current harness; mandated target-Mac proof plus live account/client matrix |

The existing root policy prefers complete migrations and no legacy paths. Reconcile old roadmap constraints with this new request; do not resume an old branch or copy old fixed provider counts into the new feature. [Repository rules](https://github.com/jackin-project/jackin/blob/5bf20aaf37bbc49325072d199e09effe0678b047/AGENTS.md), [existing usage plan](https://github.com/jackin-project/jackin/tree/5bf20aaf37bbc49325072d199e09effe0678b047/plans/unified-agent-usage).

## 4. Requested product and runtime coverage

| Requested entry | Client/runtime to support | Billing and usage identity |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude` in Linux PTY | Anthropic subscription/API or explicitly configured supported external provider |
| Codex | `codex` in Linux PTY | ChatGPT/Codex subscription, OpenAI API, or supported custom Responses provider |
| Amp | `amp` in Linux PTY | Amp free/Agent/Orb/paid/workspace pools; separately linked subscription/BYOK routes where supported |
| Antigravity | Official `agy` TUI | Google Antigravity subscription or configured Gemini API billing |
| Kimi Code | New official `kimi`; supported Claude/Codex integrations | Kimi Code membership/extra usage; Moonshot PAYG separate |
| Z.AI | Supported Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes or another verified eligible client | GLM Coding Plan vs PAYG, global vs CN, personal vs team |
| Muse Code | Official `muse` binary; MSP for observation/control | Meta Muse subscription; ordinary Meta API billing separate |
| Cursor Agent | Official `agent`; some installations use `cursor-agent` | Cursor user/organization allowance, credits and on-demand spending |
| Grok Build | Official `grok` Rust TUI | Grok consumer subscription vs xAI API/team billing |
| OpenRouter | OpenCode, omp, Hermes or another verified client | OpenRouter key/account/BYOK scopes; exact model preset |
| omp | `omp`, project `can1357/oh-my-pi` | Underlying provider account; native pools must be restricted to selected accounts |
| Hermes TUI | `hermes --tui` or explicitly configured TUI mode | Underlying provider or Nous account; native profile ownership matters |
| OpenCode | `opencode` interactive mode | Underlying provider, OpenCode Go subscription or Zen PAYG |
| Additional Gemini CLI | `gemini` where account eligibility supports it | Gemini/Code Assist or API/Vertex; separate from Antigravity |
| Additional MiniMax | Supported Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Hermes configurations | Token Plan subscription or PAYG balances |

Linux TUI support must be proved with actual interactive binaries and PTYs; provider adapter presence and `--version` success are insufficient. Installer/version links appear in the relevant sections below.

## 5. Discovery paths and account isolation

| Source | Verified/default candidates | Custom-root and import rule |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `.claude`, companion `.claude.json`; macOS keychain; `.config/anthropic` named Console profiles | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`; named `ANTHROPIC_PROFILE` is a different profile concept; custom source must not fall back to global auth |
| Codex | `.codex/config.toml`; auth selected by storage backend, possibly `.codex/auth.json` or keychain | `CODEX_HOME` scopes auth/state; `--profile` chooses configuration, not independently an account |
| Amp | XDG config: `.config/amp/settings.json(c)`; historical credential candidate `.local/share/amp/secrets.json` | Verify installed native auth storage; `--settings-file` alone does not prove auth isolation; preserve data/config/cache roots |
| Antigravity | `.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`; OS keyring | Singleton observed keyring service `gemini`/account `antigravity`; per-HOME folders alone insufficient for multiple accounts |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json`, `.gemini/oauth_creds.json` | `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` is the parent to which `.gemini` is appended |
| Kimi | New `.kimi-code/config.toml` and credentials; old `.kimi` family | New `KIMI_CODE_HOME`; old family version-specific `KIMI_SHARE_DIR`; never assume OAuth migration is portable |
| Z.AI/OpenRouter/MiniMax | Explicit keys/references and provider entries in supported client stores | No universal provider-specific home should be invented |
| Muse | Official fixture/handshake shows `.muse`-style home | Use returned `museHome` and verified per-child HOME; exact native credential filename remains a local discovery gate |
| Cursor | `.cursor/cli-config.json`; editor state DB/keychain as separate candidate sources | `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` config override; verify auth/history isolation; editor auth does not automatically establish CLI launch readiness |
| Grok | `.grok/config.toml`, `.grok/auth.json` | `GROK_HOME`; preserve native auth precedence and token rotation |
| omp | `.omp/agent/agent.db`, config/model files, profile/env sources | SQLite credentials; `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `OMP_PROFILE`, conditional XDG/profile rules; parse the actual source resolver |
| Hermes | `.hermes/config.yaml`, `.env`, `auth.json`, recognized `.hermes/profiles` | `HERMES_HOME`; `hermes -p` profile; no root auth inheritance into named profiles |
| OpenCode | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth.json`, normally `.local/share/opencode/auth.json` | XDG config/data/state/cache are distinct; `.opencode`/`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` alone do not relocate auth |

Read source databases consistently, including recent WAL data, without running a client migration against the user's store. A scanner should return every selected provider entry, never copy an entire multi-provider store to supply one account. Reference helpers/commands are discoverable as unresolved configuration; don't execute them during scans.

Path evidence: [Claude authentication](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication), [Codex auth](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth), [Amp execution auth](https://ampcode.com/docs/cli/execute-mode), [Antigravity auth/install](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/install/), [Gemini configuration](https://geminicli.com/docs/reference/configuration/), [Kimi data locations](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code-cli/configuration/data-locations.html), [Cursor config](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration), [omp directory resolver](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/116190d317ca319ae17ab624cb479c76a1ca4704/packages/utils/src/dirs.ts), [Hermes profiles](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f5d192611032025d2757b07ad838921872126182/website/docs/user-guide/profiles.md), [OpenCode XDG roots](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/5a8335857b0ebec44ef6aa1d52b339cf25c329ca/packages/core/src/global.ts).

## 6. Claude Code and Anthropic

**Execution.** Linux containers are supported. A private `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` scopes credentials/config and associated account metadata; at the default location, `~/.claude.json` is a separate companion. Inspect current credential precedence: bearer/API-key/helper/cloud settings can override a saved subscription. A selected profile therefore requires a constructed per-process environment and config, not only a folder path. [Official container guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/devcontainer).

| Usage source | Evidence/auth | Available detail and required handling |
|---|---|---|
| `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`; profile `/api/oauth/profile` | R; Claude OAuth access token, appropriate profile scope and current API headers | Five-hour, weekly, optional model windows, dynamic scoped limits, extra usage. Inference-only tokens may lack quota scope. |
| Native `/usage` or `/status` | D CLI interaction; output parser version-specific | Useful fallback only in an explicitly selected profile; never run inference to obtain a quota observation. |
| `/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages`, `/v1/organizations/cost_report` | D organization reporting | Token classes, model/key/workspace groups, spend by interval. Does not itself establish remaining budget. |
| Organization/workspace rate-limit APIs | D scoped administration | Configured throughput limits, not subscription balance. |
| Eligible Enterprise spend-limit/analytics APIs | D separate scopes/credentials | Member effective monthly cap and spend where offered; keep organization/member scope explicit. |

Normalize `five_hour`, `seven_day`, model-specific named fields and current `limits[]` shapes without duplicating the same pool. Keep provider duration/reset and optional extra-usage money separate. An absent window is not full allowance. Org/workspace identity matters when merging sources.

Current Anthropic organization reporting accepts Admin API keys, OAuth with `org:admin`, or qualifying non-workspace-scoped personal/service-account credentials. A key-prefix-only rule would be too restrictive. Individual accounts and workspace-scoped keys do not automatically get these APIs. Reporting credentials stay host-side. [Usage and Cost API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/usage-cost-api), [rate limits API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/rate-limits-api), [spend limits API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/spend-limits-api).

Reference contracts: [CodexBar Claude](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/claude.md), [OpenUsage Claude](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage/blob/56378e5765f85d38ff413036fd984afe3d4664e4/docs/providers/claude.md). Reuse their account/scope and parser lessons; browser-cookie scraping is not required by this plan.

## 7. Codex and OpenAI

**Execution/auth.** Native Linux releases exist. `CODEX_HOME` scopes state and chosen auth backend; file, keyring and ephemeral modes need different discovery. A config `--profile` can select a third-party provider but does not create a separate auth home. Current auth docs include ChatGPT, API key, access token and headless device-code paths. [Official Codex auth](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth), [source releases](https://github.com/openai/codex).

Prefer the supported app-server interface of the installed version:

| Method/data | Detail |
|---|---|
| `account/read` | Identity/auth mode; match selected account/workspace |
| `account/rateLimits/read` and update notifications | `rateLimits`, `rateLimitsByLimitId`, ordinary-usage permission, primary/secondary windows, model/pool aliases |
| Window fields | `usedPercent`, actual `windowDurationMins`, `resetsAt`; primary is not necessarily a session window |
| Credits/spend controls | Optional purchased credits, unlimited flag, individual cap/used values, remaining percentage, reset and spend-control status |
| Reset-credit inventory | Earned credits, status and expiries; observation only, never redemption |
| `account/usage/read` where supported | Account token-activity summary/daily buckets; cached/absent/unsupported states must be explicit |

The public docs and generated source already differ in some evolving fields. Negotiate capabilities and keep versioned fixtures rather than assuming every installed Codex has today's fields. External token refresh is a separately negotiated experimental mode, not a universal replacement for native auth. [App-server contract](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server), [rate-limit schema](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/app-server-protocol/schema/typescript/v2/RateLimitSnapshot.ts).

Private fallback: `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with the selected OAuth token and account/workspace header. Optional reset-credit read uses the appropriate versioned endpoint. CodexBar delegates native renewal to Codex; OpenUsage documents some guarded native write-back. Jackin must choose one owner per actual credential lineage. [CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/codex.md), [OpenUsage](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage/blob/56378e5765f85d38ff413036fd984afe3d4664e4/docs/providers/codex.md).

OpenAI API billing is separate. Documented `/v1/organization/usage/completions` and `/v1/organization/costs` require appropriate organization reporting authority and pagination/scope handling. Ordinary project inference keys are insufficient for the full organization report. No stable universal prepaid-balance API was established here; legacy dashboard `credit_grants` is not a safe required contract. [Official usage reference](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/admin/subresources/organization/subresources/usage), [CodexBar OpenAI API](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/openai.md).

## 8. Amp

Use the real `amp` TUI with verified account storage. The current docs distinguish a refreshable CLI login from a Settings access token: an `AMP_API_KEY` injected into scripts must be the accepted long-lived token form, not a short-lived token copied from `amp login`. `--settings-file` scopes settings but does not prove auth isolation. Verify the installed auth filename and XDG behavior; historical `secrets.json` is a candidate, not a certified current default. [Execute-mode auth](https://ampcode.com/docs/cli/execute-mode).

Usage choices: native `amp usage` in the selected profile, or the internal bearer-auth `POST https://ampcode.com/api/internal?userDisplayBalanceInfo` implemented by reference tools. Parse free/daily usage, Agent monthly dollars, Orb monthly hours, personal paid credits, workspace balances and real billing dates. Do not compress them into a single session/weekly metric. Modern percentage-based daily allowance and older continuously refilling free-credit modes differ. [CodexBar Amp source contract](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/amp.md).

Amp can link other subscriptions, including ChatGPT in current official documentation. Record the actual funding route and any Amp-owned ancillary charge separately. An OpenAI model name alone does not reveal whether Amp or a linked OpenAI account pays. [Amp documentation](https://ampcode.com/docs).

## 9. Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI and Gemini API

Antigravity now has the official `agy` TUI and documented Linux installation. Version 1.1.11 added read-only `agy -p /usage --output-format json` and `agy -p /credits --output-format json`. These do not initiate a model turn. Version-gate the command because older binaries can interpret an unknown slash command as a prompt. [Installation/auth](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/install/), [official changelog](https://antigravity.google/changelog).

Prefer those commands when they provide the necessary data. Current rich usage can expose separate Gemini and non-Gemini/Claude/GPT five-hour and weekly pools. Preserve every actual pool. A command response can omit identity; accept it only from a verified account-owned runtime. Do not attach the ambient host's response to an arbitrary registered Google account.

Reference internal transports include:

- Local `https://127.0.0.1:<owned-port>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/` methods `RetrieveUserQuotaSummary`, `GetUserStatus`, `GetCommandModelConfigs` with version-specific CSRF/Connect headers.
- Remote `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:` methods `loadCodeAssist`, `retrieveUserQuotaSummary`, `retrieveUserQuota`, `fetchAvailableModels`, using account-bound OAuth and project scope.

CodexBar documents a tokenless local-API break at `agy >=1.2.2`; its official-command fallback is more useful than repeatedly starting a helper that cannot authenticate. Model availability fractions are not necessarily quota: an all-available response cannot become fabricated 100% allowance. Do not run onboarding APIs during monitoring. [Pinned Antigravity evidence](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/antigravity.md), [OpenUsage auth source](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage/blob/56378e5765f85d38ff413036fd984afe3d4664e4/Sources/OpenUsage/Providers/Antigravity/AntigravityAuthStore.swift).

**Gemini CLI eligibility changed.** Google's targeted deprecation notice says consumer Google OAuth access through Gemini CLI ended 18 June 2026; Standard/Enterprise remain supported. Some generic auth pages still describe old consumer login. Use the targeted notice and actual entitlement response; don't classify every 403 as migration. Keep discovered old accounts visible with a concrete reconnect/migration action. [Google deprecation notice](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/deprecations/code-assist-individuals).

Gemini/Vertex API-key billing is separate. Gemini quotas are generally project-scoped RPM/TPM/daily/model limits. `usageMetadata` is request consumption, not remaining subscription capacity. Project/billing reporting needs additional authorized scope; keys in the same project can share quota. Antigravity's Gemini API route also needs the documented `modelProvider: gemini` setting, not only a key environment variable. [Gemini API limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits), [generation schema](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content), [Antigravity auth](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/install/).

## 10. Kimi Code and Moonshot

New official Kimi Code docs describe a Node-based `kimi` family using `.kimi-code`/`KIMI_CODE_HOME`; older public Python source uses `.kimi`/`KIMI_SHARE_DIR`. This is a version-family distinction, not a reason to arbitrarily choose one directory. The new migration guide explicitly does not migrate OAuth authorizations. Scan both and record schema/version; plan relogin when required. [New installation](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code-cli/guides/getting-started.html), [migration](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code-cli/guides/migration.html), [old source](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/blob/86f136422a0aae6b217ea49e7ea1d2e8a1defcd2/src/kimi_cli/share.py).

Official supported routes include Claude Code via Anthropic Messages at `https://api.kimi.com/coding/` and Codex via native Responses at `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1`. Codex profiles need the correct `env_key` and model catalog. Current K3 variants have different context/quota characteristics; do not freeze the attachment's model strings as universal defaults. [Claude guide](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/third-party-tools/claude-code.html), [Codex guide](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/third-party-tools/codex.html).

Native new-CLI key selection uses its documented provider config or dedicated `KIMI_MODEL_*` environment mechanism. Merely setting generic `KIMI_API_KEY` is not sufficient proof of that runtime's selected model/account. [Environment reference](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code-cli/configuration/env-vars.html).

Usage:

- `GET https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/usages` is backed by first-party older CLI and current reference collectors. Auth is an appropriate Code key/OAuth token; preserve counts/ratios, durations, resets and every returned pool.
- New experimental local server documents `GET /api/v1/oauth/usage` and `/api/v1/oauth/userinfo`, protected by the local server credential. Usage can include `summary`, `limits`, and `extra_usage` balance/total cents, monthly cap/used cents and currency. The HTTP-200 body can contain an in-band error. Use the installed server's OpenAPI/schema; do not expose a new network listener unnecessarily.
- Optional web membership enrichment exists in reference collectors, but it is an internal separately authenticated source and must not be required to retain successful Code usage.

Membership currently has a rolling five-hour limit, weekly allowance, shared monthly membership cap and Extra Usage wallet. These can constrain usage simultaneously. Moonshot Open Platform PAYG is a different credential, endpoint and balance product. [Membership](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code/membership.html), [local server API](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code-cli/reference/server-api.html), [first-party usage](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/blob/86f136422a0aae6b217ea49e7ea1d2e8a1defcd2/src/kimi_cli/ui/shell/usage.py), [CodexBar Kimi](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/kimi.md).

## 11. Z.AI / GLM

Z.AI is a provider. Its official integration documentation lists eligible clients and distinct Coding Plan protocol bases:

| Protocol | Coding Plan base |
|---|---|
| Anthropic Messages | `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` |
| OpenAI Responses, including supported Codex | `https://api.z.ai/api/v1` |

Wire compatibility does not automatically make every third-party client eligible for the subscription. Keep global Z.AI, CN BigModel, PAYG and Coding Plan identities separate. [Official tool support](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/others).

Current plans use weighted credits with five-hour and weekly limits; cache/output/model/time mix changes consumption, so there is no fixed token-left conversion. Old account plans still need their own returned units. [Plan overview](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/overview).

Reference quota source: `GET https://api.z.ai/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit`; optional `/api/monitor/usage/model-usage` and subscription metadata. These are internal source-derived interfaces. Decode `data.limits[]`, both new `CREDIT_LIMIT` and older `TOKENS_LIMIT`, plus separate `TIME_LIMIT` for tools/MCP. Use real period metadata and `nextResetTime` units; do not rely on order or invent timezone corrections for implausible resets.

CN team endpoints use explicit organization/project selectors and differing `type` values for quota/model reports. Missing selectors can produce successful HTTP with empty data. Optional analytics/balance failure is partial failure; don't erase good quota. No verified general global Z.AI PAYG-balance endpoint was established here. [CodexBar Z.AI](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/zai.md), [collector](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/Sources/CodexBarCore/Resources/Plugins/zai.js).

## 12. Muse Code

The official Meta SDK controls a real `muse` host through MSP and does not include that binary. Official fixtures establish Linux host contexts and `museHome`; the quickstart supports selecting a profile through the child HOME. The exact native credential filename, supported Linux release artifact/architecture and fresh-install authentication still require local verification because public product pages returned login-required responses during research. Do not invent `MUSE_HOME`, an installer URL, or a portable auth file. [Official SDK](https://github.com/meta-models/muse-code-sdk/blob/94e98141a8074d50d2ac418de7acb5b16d8024fa/README.md), [vendor entry](https://dev.meta.ai/docs/muse-code).

**Preferred official observation:** MSP `usage/read` and `usage/changed`. Subscription usage contains `observedAtMs`, tier, a window with `usedPercent/resetsAtMs/windowDurationMins`, and weekly `usedPercent/resetsAtMs`. The response may omit usage when no observation exists, and percentages above 100 are valid. Re-reading cached data must not reset its freshness timestamp. [Pinned protocol schema](https://github.com/meta-models/muse-code-sdk/blob/94e98141a8074d50d2ac418de7acb5b16d8024fa/python/schema/msp/stable/msp.schema.json), [generated usage method](https://github.com/meta-models/muse-code-sdk/blob/gh-pages/next/generated/msp/methods/usage-read/index.html).

The official changelog describes `/usage` refreshing subscription details. Verify the installed host's structured refresh route; a cached MSP getter is not that operation. [Changelog](https://github.com/meta-models/muse-code-sdk/blob/94e98141a8074d50d2ac418de7acb5b16d8024fa/CHANGELOG.md).

**Conditional internal source:** omp uses `POST https://api.meta.ai/muse-code/key` with account OAuth, API-version header and `{}` to read subscription metadata. This response can also return an API key. Treat it as credential exchange until proven safe for passive monitoring: whitelist only non-secret usage fields, never send onboarding flags, respect 429/backoff, and verify whether requests mint/rotate credentials. Do not use a potentially mutating key exchange as an unconditional read-only polling fallback. [omp auth](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/116190d317ca319ae17ab624cb479c76a1ca4704/packages/ai/src/registry/oauth/muse-code.ts), [usage collector](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/116190d317ca319ae17ab624cb479c76a1ca4704/packages/ai/src/usage/muse-code.ts).

## 13. Cursor Agent

Cursor officially has a Linux interactive CLI. Resolve the actual executable/version carefully because `agent` is a generic name. Auth uses native login or `CURSOR_API_KEY`; config overrides do not by themselves prove all auth/history storage is isolated. Editor `state.vscdb` and native keychain can be usage/discovery sources distinct from CLI launch credentials. [CLI installation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/installation), [auth](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/authentication), [config](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/configuration).

| Source | Scope/classification | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `POST https://api.cursor.com/teams/spend` | D Enterprise Admin API with suitable admin auth | Member spend, billing period, effective limits; keep team and member scopes distinct |
| `/teams/filtered-usage-events` | D Enterprise Admin API | Tokens/model/events/cost/charged amounts; paginate and label aggregation delay |
| `https://api2.cursor.sh/aiserver.v1.DashboardService/GetCurrentPeriodUsage` | R internal Connect RPC with selected account token | Current plan allowance/spend, individual/pool information |
| Same service `GetPlanInfo`, `GetCreditGrantsBalance`, `GetSandUsageStatus` | R optional enrichment | Plan, credit grants, separate Grok Bot quota |
| `https://cursor.com/api/usage-summary`, `/api/usage?user=…` and dashboard routes | R internal session APIs | Current/legacy quota, billing dates and optional export detail |

A personal execution key does not imply Enterprise reporting access. Keep actual charged amount, estimated model cost, included quota and credit grant units separate. History is not a live quota source: the official events API is hourly aggregated and should not be hammered at the overview interval. Preserve successful primary usage when optional credits/history fails. [API availability](https://cursor.com/docs/api), [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api), [OpenUsage Cursor](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage/blob/56378e5765f85d38ff413036fd984afe3d4664e4/docs/providers/cursor.md), [CodexBar Cursor](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/cursor.md).

## 14. Grok Build / xAI

The official Rust TUI supports Linux releases, `grok`, `.grok/auth.json` and `GROK_HOME`; device login is suitable for headless/container contexts. Stored subscription auth can outrank ambient `XAI_API_KEY`. A key-selected instance must not reuse an already signed-in subscription home. [Grok source](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/482711333c7195dc16a272777f86086d615e2afb/README.md), [auth guide](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/482711333c7195dc16a272777f86086d615e2afb/crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/02-authentication.md).

First-party CLI billing source reads `GET https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/billing?format=credits` with its native OAuth/user/version headers. Reference tools also use `grok agent stdio` billing RPC. Preserve `creditUsagePercent`, typed current weekly/monthly period, prepaid balance, on-demand cap/used, unified billing state and optional plan metadata. Legacy monthly fields cannot relabel a current weekly response. Do not invent a five-hour session meter. Optional auto-top-up status is display-only. [First-party billing implementation](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/482711333c7195dc16a272777f86086d615e2afb/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/billing.rs), [CodexBar Grok](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/grok.md).

xAI developer API/team billing uses a separate documented Management API credential, with prepaid balance, postpaid limit/invoice and historical usage reads. An ordinary inference key is not that management credential. Never query consumer Grok billing by reinterpreting a developer key. [Management guide](https://docs.x.ai/developers/management-api-guide), [billing reference](https://docs.x.ai/developers/rest-api-reference/management/billing).

## 15. OpenRouter

Model selection belongs to the selected client/account configuration. Examples of structural forms: OpenCode or omp `openrouter/<organization>/<model>`; Hermes separates `--provider openrouter` from `--model <organization>/<model>`. Validate the exact current identifier and preserve it; no silent auto-router or fallback substitution.

All API paths below use `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`:

| Path | Auth/scope | Fields and caveats |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /key` | D ordinary selected inference key | Key cap, `limit_remaining`, reset policy, lifetime/daily/weekly/monthly usage, BYOK variants, optional request counters and expiry |
| `GET /credits` | D Management key | Account total credits/usage; compute balance with exact money precision; management failure must not suppress `/key` |
| `GET /activity` | D Management key | Last 30 completed UTC days; model/provider/endpoint, tokens/requests/spend and key/user/workspace filters; not today's live usage |
| `GET /analytics/meta`, `POST /analytics/query` | D Management reporting | Discover supported dimensions/metrics and query bounded detail; no fixed future schema assumption |
| `GET /generation?id=…` | D authorized key and known generation | Request-level information; not an account-history enumeration API |
| `GET /models` / applicable documented catalog | D catalog | Model picker and protocol capability validation; catalog price/context is not an allowance |

For a resettable key cap, use coherent cap/remaining values for its period; do not divide all-time spend by a periodic cap. A null cap means no configured key cap, not infinite funded credit. Do not draw weekly/monthly percentage bars when only period spend and no matching denominator are available. A model through OpenRouter uses OpenRouter billing; BYOK needs explicit separate attribution to avoid double-counting.

## 16. omp, Hermes and OpenCode

### omp / Oh My Pi

The requested `omp.sh` is `can1357/oh-my-pi`. Install a pinned official release or its supported package; actual interactive command is `omp`. Its source contains many provider/auth/usage adapters and a SQLite store, including named profiles. Account selection and a model ID are independent: a provider/model string alone cannot choose between two credentials for that provider. [README](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/116190d317ca319ae17ab624cb479c76a1ca4704/README.md), [providers](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/116190d317ca319ae17ab624cb479c76a1ca4704/docs/providers.md).

Its auth broker is a useful reference for coalescing/cache/refresh. However, `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_ACCOUNT_POOL_FILE` is explicitly trusted-client routing, not server authorization: omitted providers can remain unrestricted and a bearer can still expose raw credentials. Passing a full broker token into a container plus a filtered file does not meet selected-accounts-only admission. Stage only chosen material or use proven server-enforced scope. [Broker contract](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/116190d317ca319ae17ab624cb479c76a1ca4704/docs/auth-broker-gateway.md).

### Hermes TUI

Use `hermes --tui`, or explicitly enable `HERMES_TUI=1`/the configured TUI interface. Classic CLI remains default in the inspected guide. Modern TUI requires Node ≥20 plus the Python agent runtime and a PTY; prebuild its frontend during container construction. `HERMES_TUI_DIR` can select prebuilt `dist/entry.js`. Jackin core remains Rust; upstream runtime dependencies are part of running the requested agent. [TUI guide](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f5d192611032025d2757b07ad838921872126182/website/docs/user-guide/tui.md).

Hermes supports direct/provider gateway accounts and its own Nous Portal route. Its profiles must not be shared by concurrent processes. Clone behavior deliberately drops rotating OAuth credentials because duplicated grants can race. Use distinct runtime state and a proven credential owner. Adapter availability does not automatically establish provider approval for every subscription, especially Anthropic OAuth. [Profiles](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f5d192611032025d2757b07ad838921872126182/website/docs/user-guide/profiles.md), [provider integration](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f5d192611032025d2757b07ad838921872126182/website/docs/integrations/providers.md).

### OpenCode, Go and Zen

Interactive `opencode` differs from headless `opencode run`. Auth entries are provider-keyed in XDG data. Two concurrent accounts for the same provider require separate auth/data roots or another verified native mechanism. Preserve only selected entries when staging. [CLI guide](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/5a8335857b0ebec44ef6aa1d52b339cf25c329ca/packages/web/src/content/docs/cli.mdx), [auth source](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/5a8335857b0ebec44ef6aa1d52b339cf25c329ca/packages/opencode/src/auth/index.ts).

OpenCode Go has a first-party source-backed, undocumented `GET https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage` with Bearer key. It returns `usage.rolling/weekly/monthly` entries containing status, percent and reset timestamp. `1` means 1%, not 100%. A valid key without Go entitlement can receive a distinct 403. The published fallback route does not prove every current live per-model field; collect a sanitized live response and preserve model pools only when supplied. [Usage route](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/5a8335857b0ebec44ef6aa1d52b339cf25c329ca/packages/console/app/src/routes/zen/go/v1/usage.ts), [Go docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/go/).

Zen PAYG balance is separate. No stable public total-Zen-balance API was verified here. A Go meter can be exhausted while configured balance fallback still permits inference; display both sources where exposed. Local OpenCode session cost is not remote Zen balance. Current provider docs also caution against assuming Claude subscription plugins remain supported. [Zen](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/), [provider support](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/).

## 17. MiniMax

Retain this account provider because the attachment and existing Jackin code use it. Current Token Plan has rolling/weekly allowance, credits and team/resource scope; Subscription Keys and PAYG keys are different products. Claude uses the Anthropic-compatible base, while current official Codex guide describes Responses at `https://api.minimax.io/v1`. Model settings are versioned configuration, not account identity. [Token Plan](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/token-plan/intro), [Claude integration](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/token-plan/claude-code), [Codex integration](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/token-plan/codex).

First-party MiniMax CLI routes subscription usage to `GET https://api.minimax.io/v1/token_plan/remains`, and PAYG balance to `GET https://api.minimax.io/account/query_balance`. Preserve per-model/service interval and weekly totals/used/reset/status, remaining percentages, boosts and unlimited states. A boost can exceed the base allowance; clamp only visual geometry, not the source value. PAYG balances include cash/voucher/credit/debt-like amounts as decimal strings. Region and currency must be explicit. [Endpoint source](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/cli/blob/bfbb4cb75ec343149eaccfd668c5011aa27bcf2b/src/client/endpoints.ts), [response types](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/cli/blob/bfbb4cb75ec343149eaccfd668c5011aa27bcf2b/src/types/api.ts).

Older Coding Plan and regional web endpoints remain reference evidence, not automatic fallback hosts for every key. Never send a credential to a different region merely because the first request failed. [CodexBar MiniMax](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/b6e65a83dc471817b7ff7678e68e0204c9dd604f/docs/minimax.md).

## 18. What to adopt from the references

| Reference pattern | Adaptation for Jackin |
|---|---|
| Provider descriptors and ordered fetch strategies | Capability catalog with documented/source/internal status and installed-version gates |
| Auth store → usage client → mapper | Clear secret boundary and pure response normalization; use existing Rust module tiers |
| Native usage/API fallback | Identity-bound fallback only; no ambient default-account substitution |
| Rich provider-specific snapshots | Typed extensible metrics/windows/pools, not fixed session/week fields or arbitrary JSON |
| Last-good data and partial enrichment | Preserve healthy metrics and show stale/permission/source-specific errors |
| Account/source dedup | Stable registrations plus verified billing/credential lineage; retain key-specific caps |
| Shared scheduling | Extend existing Jackin broker; one generation, bounded per-provider concurrency and explicit credential-refresh owner |
| Existing native local-log readers | Optional measured coverage; never use pricing estimates to invent subscription allowance |

Do not transplant whole implementations. Reference code can contain stale docs, private APIs, global active-account assumptions or browser-derived credentials unsuitable for Jackin's container model. Review licenses before copying code; implementing documented behavior and tested protocol contracts in Jackin's own architecture avoids needless dependencies.

## 19. Execution-time questions that remain open

| Open fact | How execution resolves it | Honest state until resolved |
|---|---|---|
| Current Amp native auth path/root override | Inspect installed CLI source/help/profile writes and authenticate in isolated local fixture/profile | Config/path candidate; container auth unverified |
| Muse official Linux artifact/native credential format | Use user's installed version/authenticated vendor docs; inspect handshake and bounded profile writes | Runtime/install/auth capability unverified |
| Antigravity multiple-account native keyring | Prove private credential namespaces and concurrent selected identity in Linux container | Multiple-account subscription launch unverified |
| Cursor config override covers auth/history | Native two-profile concurrent launch and identity checks | Config override documented; full isolation unverified |
| OpenCode Go live model schema | Redacted real `/usage` response plus documented model-pool comparison | Shared windows supported by source; extra model fields unverified |
| OpenCode Zen/general provider cash balances | Find actual authorized documented/source endpoint and test scope | No published/verified source, not zero balance |
| OAuth copied-grant rotation | Provider-specific ownership/refresh stress test with host + monitor + sessions | Do not enable unsafe clone/write-back |
| Subscription allowed in a third-party client | Current vendor and client support evidence plus eligible account test | Adapter available may still mean entitlement unverified |
| Current exact model names/install releases | Current catalog/release lookup and pinned test artifact | User-configurable with validation; no silently guessed latest version |

These are bounded research/validation tasks for the orchestrator. They do not justify leaving the rest unfinished, and they do not justify claiming universal live support. The full implementation checklist specifies how to close each lane locally.
